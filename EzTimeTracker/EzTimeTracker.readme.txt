Introducing EZ Time Tracker
EZ Time Tacker for Android is a simple way to track the passage of time. Punch in/punch out for user definable 
activity categories. The app will keep track of the interval between punch in/out, or between the punch in for a 
current activity and a new punch in (there is no need to punch out between activities.) The interval is recorded 
even if the app is terminated for any reason.

EZ Time Tacker currently includes two types of reports: time sheet and summary. Time sheet shows an ordered list of all punch in/out intervals with the category, in and out times and total durations displayed. The summary shows totals either by date or category, grouped (or in the case of category, sub-grouped) by day, week or month. Both reports are filterable by a date range. Both reports are also exportable to the device's SD card.

EZ Time Tacker is available now for free at the Android market. The source code is available under Apache License 2.0 at http://code.google.com/p/eztimetracker/ so... if you don't like it... fix it! (You might do me the favor of sharing any changes you make, although under the Apache license, you are not required to do so.)

EZ Time Tracker was originally written by Eric Z up to version 1.6 july 2010 
(see http://zettsetttech.blogspot.com/ and http://eztimetracker.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/)

The current version is maintained by k3b (see https://github.com/k3b/EzTimeTracker)

			- Expired Categories are shown as [-- xxx --] or not shown at all if disabled in the options.
			- If the Category is in use the Category Editor shows how many usages there are and how many hours they have.
				
"Remote controlling EZ Time Tracker"
EZ Time Tracker registers a broadcastreceiver that enables other android-apps to do punch-in/out
that listens to the broadcast-indent "com.zettsett.timetracker.action.COMMAND"

The broadcast-data contains what to do:

- cmd:start:MyCategory   
	does a "punch in" with category "MyCategory" 
	(and punches out the previos if neccessary).
	If "MyCategory" does not exist it is created.
- cmd:stop
	does a "punch out"				

For example you can use Kebab-s android app "Llama" (http://kebabapps.blogspot.com/search/label/Llama)
to create a location based events that can trigger Actions:
- type=AndroidIntend/CustomBroadcast/
- action="com.zettsett.timetracker.action.COMMAND"
- data="cmd:start:AtHome"

This will do a "EZ Time Tracker punch in" for category "AtHome" every time you 
receive the event "Enter wlan-area-home" or "Enter cellphone-area-home"
